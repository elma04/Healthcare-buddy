# HealthCare Buddy

**Description:**
HealthCare Buddy is a chatbot designed to assist users with health-related queries. It provides personalized recommendations based on user input, including symptom precautions, medication suggestions, and report analysis. Additionally, it helps users locate the nearest hospitals, doctors, and pharmacies using their current location.

## Features:
- Symptom analysis and precaution suggestions
- Medication recommendations based on user symptoms
- Health report analysis (based on user-provided data)
- Nearby hospital, doctor, and pharmacy location suggestions (using Google Place API)
- Interactive user interface for seamless chatbot communication

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python**: Backend logic and chatbot integration.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive user interface.
- **OpenAI LLM Model**: For generating natural language responses and analyzing user health-related queries.
- **Google Place API**: For providing location-based suggestions for hospitals, doctors, and pharmacies.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-buddy.git
   cd healthcare-buddy
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up API keys:
   - Get your OpenAI API key and Google Place API key.
