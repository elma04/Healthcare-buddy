**Description:**
HealthCare Buddy is an advanced conversational agent engineered to facilitate comprehensive healthcare consultations through intelligent natural language processing. It offers a plethora of health-related insights, including precautionary advice for symptoms, pharmacological recommendations, and in-depth analyses of health reports like ct-scans, blood test reports, x-rays. Moreover, the chatbot is augmented with geospatial capabilities, enabling it to provide precise localization of proximate healthcare institutions, including hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies, based on the user's real-time geographic coordinates.

## Features:
- **Symptomatology Evaluation:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to extrapolate tailored preventive measures corresponding to user-reported symptoms.
- **Pharmacological Guidance:** Delivers precise medication suggestions, drawing upon symptom-specific pharmaceutical knowledge.
- **Clinical Report Interpretation:** Analyzes and deciphers user-submitted health data, offering clinically relevant insights and diagnostic perspectives.
- **Geospatial Healthcare Facility Discovery:** Employs the Google Place API to execute precise geolocation-based searches, identifying nearby medical establishments, practitioners, and pharmacies 
  in accordance with the user's positional data.
- **Interactive Conversational Interface:** Built using Streamlit to ensure seamless bidirectional communication, fostering an intuitive user experience while engaging with the chatbot.

## Tools and Technologies:
